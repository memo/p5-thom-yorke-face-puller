This is a processed version of the Radiohead Tom Yorke data found at 
http://code.google.com/p/radiohead/

The data if cropped to the face, noise is minimized, and most important, the data is quantized to a 100x100 grid around the face area, and only the height and intensity is stored.
This is so the same nth dot info can be carried across frames.

See www.memo.tv for more info.
